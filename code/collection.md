 Problem statement 1: How would you iterate over a Collection ? Check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/ExternalInternalItrator.java) for use of new forEach api.
 
 Problem statement 2: How would change a value of a corresponding key in a map ? check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/MapComputing.java) for performing computation directly on the value of specific key of a map by using different compute apis.
 
 Problem statement 3: If value to key does not exist then set a default value else re-map the key after performing some computation on old value.check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/MapMerging.java) for new merge api.
 
 Problem Statement 4: If the key is present then the value is replaced by newValue. If the key is not present, does nothing. check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/MapReplace.java)  for new replace api of map.
 
 Problem Statement 5: If the key's old value matches with specified old value then replace with new else does nothing. Check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/MapReplace.java). 
 
 Problem Statement 6: How to replace all the values by its double? check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/MapReplace.java) new replaceAll api of map.
 
 Problem statement 7: How would you put a value to a key only if the key is absent?  Check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/NewGetAndPut.java) for new putIfAbsent api.
 
 Problem statement 8: How would get a default value if the key is missing in the map. Check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/NewGetAndPut.java) for new getOrDefault api.
 
 Problem Statement 9: How to remove an element from list for a given condition?  Check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/RemoveIf.java)  new removeIf api which is a good example of abstracting over behavior.
 
 Problem Statement 10: How to remove the key only if its associated with the given value ? check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/RemoveMap.java)  new remove method variant of map. 
 
 Problem statement 11: How would you sort a list? How would you get a new instance of sorted list ? check [this](./src/com/laxmikant/java8/collection/SortingCollection.java)  new sort method
